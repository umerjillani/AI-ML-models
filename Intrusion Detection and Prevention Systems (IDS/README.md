## Pandas & Numpy:
Data from intrusion detection systems can be imported using Pandas for cleaning and transforming. Analyze patterns of flagged packets, the types of attacks (e.g., DDoS, brute force), and how these evolve over time.
Numpy can process large datasets efficiently, providing the ability to perform real-time analysis of network traffic and identify potential threats.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Build an AI model using Scikit-learn that learns from historical attack data and predicts new intrusions with better accuracy. You can develop custom classifiers for different types of attacks and tune the IDS to minimize false positives and negatives.
Use Matplotlib to visualize these predictions and show administrators the types and locations of detected intrusions in real-time.
