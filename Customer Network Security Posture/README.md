## Pandas & Numpy:
Use Pandas to import and analyze customer data on security incidents, firewall configuration, security vulnerabilities, and network architecture.
Numpy can assist in calculating trends, averages, and statistical analysis to determine the security posture of customer networks (e.g., how often security patches are applied, frequency of vulnerabilities).
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Train predictive models using Scikit-learn to assess the likelihood of a security breach based on historical data. For example, if a customer has unpatched vulnerabilities or a high number of open ports, the AI model can predict the probability of a breach.
Use Matplotlib to create dashboard visualizations that provide insights into the current security status, with predictions and recommendations for improving the network security posture.
