# Network Capacity Planning Using AI/ML

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use AI and Machine Learning to forecast future network capacity needs based on historical traffic data. By leveraging Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**, we predict bandwidth utilization and help in capacity planning for network infrastructure.

## Use Case: Network Capacity Planning

### Problem
Network administrators often need to forecast network capacity to handle future traffic loads and prevent congestion. This project uses historical data on network traffic to predict bandwidth utilization in the future, allowing proactive planning for infrastructure upgrades.

### Approach
We utilize the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Historical network traffic data, including features such as bandwidth utilization, number of users, and network latency.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the data for analysis. Time-based features such as hour and day of the week are added.
3. **Model Building**: A **Linear Regression** model is trained to predict future bandwidth needs.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and predictions are compared with actual usage data.
5. **Visualization**: Data visualizations using **Matplotlib** show trends and performance.
