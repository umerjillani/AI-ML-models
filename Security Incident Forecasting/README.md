## Pandas & Numpy:
Analyze historical data on security incidents (e.g., DDoS attacks, phishing attempts, malware infections) using Pandas for data preparation and Numpy for statistical modeling.
Track trends and patterns over time to identify seasonal spikes or recurring issues that could lead to future incidents.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Create forecasting models using Scikit-learnâ€™s time series analysis or regression algorithms to predict the likelihood of future security incidents.
Matplotlib can be used to plot incident forecasts over time, helping network administrators to proactively strengthen defenses during high-risk periods.
