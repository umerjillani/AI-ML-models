## Pandas & Numpy:
IT network systems generate massive amounts of logs (e.g., firewall logs, IDS/IPS logs). By using Pandas, you can load, clean, and analyze this log data.
Numpy can be used for high-performance computation, such as calculating statistical properties like the mean, variance, and deviation of network traffic.
This helps in identifying patterns or anomalies (e.g., unusual spikes in traffic, unauthorized access attempts) in a systematic and scalable way.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
By feeding this log data into an AI model like Random Forest or K-Nearest Neighbors in Scikit-learn, you can classify potential security threats versus normal activity.
Matplotlib can be used to visually represent traffic patterns, anomaly detection, and potential risks. This aids in monitoring the network in real-time and detecting anomalies in network behavior.
