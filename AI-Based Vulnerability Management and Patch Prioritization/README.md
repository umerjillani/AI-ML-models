# AI-Based Vulnerability Management and Patch Prioritization

## Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can be used to prioritize patching of vulnerabilities based on factors such as CVSS score, exploitability, and time since last patch. The goal is to create a model that helps prioritize which vulnerabilities should be patched first to minimize security risks.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Model Building**: PyTorch
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib

---

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains example datasets for vulnerabilities and their exploitability scores.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data analysis, model building, and data visualization.
- **`models/`**: Folder to store trained models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (optional) for interactive analysis.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies needed for the project.

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/umerjillani/AI-Vulnerability-Management.git
cd AI-Vulnerability-Management
