# AI and Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my AI and Machine Learning project repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of a real-world AI use case, starting from environment setup through Conda to building and deploying machine learning models using popular Python libraries and frameworks. Below is an outline of the workflow and tools used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
To ensure consistent development, the project begins by setting up a Python environment using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/). This helps manage dependencies and libraries required for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

**Steps to create the environment:**
```bash
# Create a new Conda environment
conda create -n ml_project python=3.8

# Activate the environment
conda activate ml_project

# Install necessary packages
conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### 2. Use Case Definition
In this project, we define a specific AI/ML use case and problem set. This involves identifying the business problem or objective and breaking it down into a machine learning task. 

**Example Use Case:** Predict customer churn based on demographic and usage data.

### 3. Data Collection & Analysis
We utilize libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` to handle large datasets, perform preprocessing, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

**Key operations include:**
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Statistical summary and insights
- Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Inspect data
data.head()
```

### 4. Data Visualization
Data visualization is essential for understanding patterns and relationships within the dataset. This project uses `matplotlib` to visualize distributions, trends, and correlations in the data, aiding in decision-making during the model development process.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot data distribution
data['column_name'].hist()
plt.show()
```

### 5. Building Machine Learning Models
The core of this project is building a machine learning model using `scikit-learn`. The model selection process is driven by the problem set, data characteristics, and performance metrics. We start by splitting the data into training and testing sets, then fit and evaluate different models.

**Key steps include:**
- Data splitting (train-test)
- Model training and evaluation
- Model selection (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForest model
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
