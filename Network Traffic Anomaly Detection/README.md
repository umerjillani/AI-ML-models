## Pandas & Numpy:
Network traffic data can be analyzed using Pandas to inspect patterns, bandwidth usage, and protocol distribution. Numpy can handle real-time data processing and manipulation.
You can segment traffic data by IP, time, or geographical region and look for any abnormal patterns such as sudden traffic surges or unexpected packets.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Anomalies can be detected using machine learning algorithms like isolation forests or clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means). These models can be trained on normal traffic data to predict deviations in future traffic.
Visualize the anomalies over time using Matplotlib to help network engineers quickly identify potential threats or misconfigurations.
