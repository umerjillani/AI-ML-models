## Pandas & Numpy:
Collect data on network device performance (e.g., CPU utilization, bandwidth usage, device temperature) using Pandas for data aggregation and cleaning. Numpy can help in performing calculations such as device failure likelihood based on past performance data.
This data analysis can be used to predict when a device might fail or need maintenance.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Use regression models in Scikit-learn to predict the lifespan of a network device or when maintenance will be needed. You can also predict device failures that could impact the networkâ€™s security (e.g., firewalls or routers going offline).
Visualize the predictive maintenance schedule using Matplotlib, showing which devices are at risk of failure or require immediate attention.
