## Pandas & Numpy:
Gather user activity logs (e.g., login attempts, file access, privilege escalation) and analyze them using Pandas to detect any unusual behavior patterns. Numpy can handle the computation-intensive tasks, such as tracking user access patterns over time.
Detect deviations from regular behavior, such as sudden access to sensitive files or abnormal login times.
## Scikit-learn & Matplotlib:
Train an AI model to classify behaviors as normal or potentially malicious based on historical user activity data using Scikit-learn.
Use Matplotlib to visualize user behavior patterns and highlight anomalies that might indicate insider threats or compromised accounts.
